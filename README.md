# images-scraper

This a simple way to scrape Google images using Puppeteer. The headless browser will behave as a 'normal' user and scrolls to the bottom of the page until we have enough results.

# Installation

`npm install images-scraper`

# Example

Give me the first 200 images of Banana's from Google (using headless browser)

```js
var Scraper = require("images-scraper");

let google = new Scraper.Google({
	keyword: "banana",
	limit: 200,
	puppeteer: {
		headless: false
	},
	tbs: {
		// every possible tbs search option, some examples and more info: http://jwebnet.net/advancedgooglesearch.html
		isz: undefined, // options: l(arge), m(edium), i(cons), etc.
		itp: undefined, // options: clipart, face, lineart, news, photo
		ic: undefined, // options: color, gray, trans
		sur: undefined // options: fmc (commercial reuse with modification), fc (commercial reuse), fm (noncommercial reuse with modification), f (noncommercial reuse)
	}
});

(async () => {
	const results = await google.start();
	console.log("results", results);
})();
```

# Options

Options that can be passed to the scraper:

```js
var options = {
	keyword: "banana", // required,
	userAgent:
		"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:64.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/64.0", // the user agent
	limit: 10, // amount of results to fetch
	puppeteer: {}, // puppeteer options, for example, { headless: false }
	tbs: {} // every possible tbs search option, some examples and more info: http://jwebnet.net/advancedgooglesearch.html
};
```
